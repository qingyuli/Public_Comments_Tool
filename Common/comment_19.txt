Attached please find our comments in response to Episode-Based Cost Measures, 12-23-2016.
Comments relate to:
1. Quality measures -It will be difficult to establish a priori quality measures for these complex episodes. Rather we suggest that quality measures focus on the episodes resulting beneficiary's pathway.
2. Dual eligibles and Medicaid - Depending upon the beneficiary's state Medicaid benefits will vary and could substitute for or add to Medicare costs. Unfortunately, we can suggest no easy answer.
3. HCC Percentile Ranking - If multiple admissions during the performance year, the
beneficiary has the identical HCC ranking based on the prior year HCCs. We suggest using 2 years HCC data and perhaps consider the 2 year "trend."
Thanks for the opportunity to respond. Please contact me if clarifications are necessary.

Chronic conditions and dual eligibles

The 21st Century Cures Act raises dual eligibles to a new level of prominence as a possible stratification metric in IPPS 2018. Consider sorting proposed episodes based on their dual eligible status.

Figure 3 Dual Eligible Expenditures


For dual eligibles, Medicaid expenditures exceeded Medicare expenditures. Maryland Medicaid is generous compared to some other states. Are these Medicaid payments taken into account in generating Medicare episode costs?

Currently if a beneficiary has multiple admissions in the performance year the beneficiary is determined to have the same HCC Percentile Ranking using prior years data. Recommendation is to use two years rather than one year to set the HCC at percentile average. Alternatively, for performance year, use higher percentile if year 2 greater than year 1 and lower percentile if year 2 less than year 1. This could capture what might be a trend.
