I am a consultant for 10+ professional societies who are interested in commenting on the draft MACRA episode groups and trigger codes. However, we are confused about this latest posting, which only seems to include the names of the episode groups and the trigger codes, but no other relevant information about the episode parameters/relevant codes. Should we assume that the Episode Workbooks posted late last year and available for download at the very bottom of this website are still valid and should be matched up to the newest list of episode groups and trigger codes? If not, when can we expect to see more details about each episode beyond the trigger codes?

As a follow-up to my earlier inquiry below, I was wondering if you could clarify whether the 10 episode-based cost measures that were finalized for the 2017 MIPS are still evolving under the process outlined below or if we can assume that CMS will maintain them in their current form going forward (when the cost category is potentially no longer zeroed out). We are giving a presentation on episodes that impact gastroenterologists and they would like to know more about what the future of cost measurement under MIPS looks like. Since colonoscopy was included on the list of 10 approved for MIPS this year, we would appreciate some insight on what we they can expect in the future in terms of this particular cost measure. Thanks so much for your ongoing assistance.
