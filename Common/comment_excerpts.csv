In framing the Acute Inpatient Medical Condition Episode Groups, CMS identified Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) relevant to the groups. We are concerned that an individual DRG contains heterogeneous ICD-10 condition diagnoses that may have very different treatment courses and therefore costs. DRGs are designed to separate patients into groups that are supposed to have different costs due to their underlying medical conditions. The Major Complication or Comorbidity (MCC) and Complication or Comorbidity (CC) designations allow hospitals to identify patients who have the potential need for more medical care and thereby higher medical costs. For example, the Allergic Reactions episode and its associated DRGs (915 and 916) could range from allergic dermatitis (L23.7 or L23.9) to anaphylaxis (T78 or T80) as identified by ICD-10 coding. The COPD episode and its associated DRGs (190, 191, and 192) is another example of differential in costs (2014 averages for each DRG nationally are $7,088.08, $5,672.03, and $4,200.94, respectively) further marked by variances due to specific clinical circumstances as denoted by ICD-10 coding. This is a wide diversity of potential diagnoses with radically different expected costs. It is not clear to SHM that these differences would be accounted for in broad episode measures.","An individual DRG contains heterogeneous ICD-10 condition diagnoses.

In the asthma care APM being developed by our organization, we have stratified severity of disease into four categories for the “Continued Care for Difficult-to-Control Asthma” phase of care based, among other things, on the presence of specific comorbidities.

The reasoning for this is threefold. First, imaging crosses a number of specialties and has applications to a number of different organ systems. Organizing imaging in its own silo could provide efficiencies in workflow. Second, advanced diagnostic imaging will be subject the mandate in §218 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA). §218 of PAMA requires a professional who orders an advanced imaging test to use a clinical decision support tool to confirm that they have consulted appropriate use criteria prior to ordering the test. Over time ordering professionals who are outliers will be subject to prior authorization. § 218 of PAMA acts as a quality-based gatekeeper or a check to the imaging silo, preventing inappropriate overuse as a fee-for-service “carve out.” It also does not undermine the significant efforts of the cardiovascular subspecialty societies encouraging participation in imaging laboratory accreditation programs. These programs have a proven track record of success in improving imaging quality and interpretation. 
Finally, the imaging silo could yield valuable information on the precise effect a given modality has on patient outcome and could later be incorporated into the larger bundle. For example, if a patient has a poor quality imaging test that leads to an unnecessary catheterization, then it is possible to pinpoint exactly which test or interpretation led to the inappropriate catheterization.","There should be an advanced diagnostic imaging “silo” that would initially be separate from the larger episode group or bundle.

CSRO believes the RA episode is prime for sub-groups parsed by disease progression and whether the pharmaceutical therapy chosen is covered under Part D or Part B. For example, Felty’s Syndrome is difficult to treat and the standard of care is directed against underlying RA with an additional goal of treating neutropenia and recurrent infections. 
Also, depending on how drugs are incorporated into the RA episode group, it will be important to differentiate between whether Part D or Part B drugs are chosen (see below). Given the above, it is critical to further subdivide the RA episode group to yield a more clinically homogeneous cohort of patients with similar expected costs.","This episode group is a candidate for sub-groups parsed by disease progression and whether the pharmaceutical therapy chosen is covered under Part D or Part B.

The following HCPCS codes for mechanical pneumatic compression should therefore be included in the list of “Relevant Services” under Method A and “Medical Equipment” under Method B: E0676, E0673, A9900, and E0671.","Immobilization after an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery increases a patient's risk for a venous thromboembolism (VTE) event. The clinician has to choose a prophylactic agent by weighing the risk of thromboembolic disease, and also the risk of bleeding complications in the patient. Increasingly, mechanical pneumatic compression prophylaxis is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) post-discharge, and there is substantial evidence supporting its benefits. The following HCPCS codes for mechanical pneumatic compression should therefore be included in the list of assigned services under Method A and “Medical Equipment” under Method B: E0676, E0673, A9900, and E0671.",Procedural
