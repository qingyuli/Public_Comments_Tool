As a CAH, we have not been able to obtain specific cost detail that has been attributed to our facility because we had less than 20 eligible pts (from SQRUR). If our reimbursement is affected by our cost then we need to be able to get this information in order to make any improvements! Hoping with MIPS we will be able to get this information for any number of eligible pts.

Also, it seems in the past we have been assigned the cost of the whole patient episode even for services that we dont even offer for patients that may have started in our facility and we transferred to pt to a larger facility with specialized care. This needs to be addressed when discussing differing rules for CAHs.
